# User Guide for p, the genral project manager
Many languages have their own project manager.
Some examples are cargo for rust, elm for elm,
lein for clojure,
you name it.

But did you ever try to use cargo as
you use elm?
You can't use one project manager as
you use another one.

This adds extra challenges to
learning a new language.
An unnecessary challenge, I think.

## Install
You need Python 3.7.3 or higher installed,
and it must be the default in

This is the general form of a p command:
```bash
p <language> <cmd>
```
If `p` can, it will detect the type
of your project,
and you can omit the <language> part.

Currently these are the basic commands that
you can use with python.
