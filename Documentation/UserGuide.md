# User Guid for p, the genral project manager
Many languages have their own project manager.
Some examples are cargo for rust, elm for elm,
lein for clojure,
you name it.

But did you ever try to use cargo as
you use elm?
You can't use one project manager as
you use another one.

This adds extra challenges to
learning a new language.
An unnecessary challenge, I think.


With p you will be able to create a project
for any (supported) language with this command:
```bash
p new <language> foo
```
This configures a project in the `foo` directory
for the `<language>` you specified.
