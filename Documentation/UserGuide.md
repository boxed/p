# User Guid for p, the genral project manager
Many languages have an own project manager.
Some examples are cargo for rust, elm for elm,
lein for clojure, you name it.

But did you ever try to use cargo as you use elm
or lein as you use elm?
If you did, I'm sorry for your failure.

One project manager for one language isn't
interchangeable with the project manager
of another language.
This adds extra challenges to
learning a new language.
An unnecessary challenge, I think.

I think the problem is now explained
sufficently and you know what problem
p tries to solve.

With p you will be able to create a project
for any (supported) language with this command:
```bash
p new <language> foo
```
This configures a project in the `foo` directory
for the `<language>` you specified.
